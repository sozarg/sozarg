# 
A dedicated programming student at UTN with a focus on Python. I am committed to expanding my skills and actively apply my learning through GitHub repositories, such as my [Â«Programacion-IÂ»](https://github.com/sozarg/Programacion-I) repo, where I showcase my progress and projects.
#
I bring a keen eye for detail and a proactive approach to problem-solving. My experience includes collaborating effectively within teams, keeping colleagues informed, and knowing when to seek assistance or work independently. With a B1 level in English, strengthened by six years of English education, I am eager to work with diverse teams and adapt to various cultural contexts.
